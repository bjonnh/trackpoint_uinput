I decided to add a Trackpoint to my MS Ergonomic 4000 keyboard.

For that I needed two things:
- ~~A Linux driver, compatible with wayland. I used uinput (user-mode devices)~~ This is not needed anymore as we use the native USB mode of the Trinket M0
- An arduino firmware that understands the Trackpoint PS/2 protocol and send that over serial


** ~~Compilation of the driver~~ (DEPRECATED)

This is not needed anymore, but I'm leaving it here as uinput is an interesting thing.

Careful, my version has the buttons 1 and 3 inverted because I had an issue in my wiring.

#+BEGIN_SRC: sh
gcc -Werror -O3 -s uinput_mouse.c -o uinput_mouse
sudo ./uinput_mouse /dev/ttyACM0  # where /dev/ttyACM0 is your serial port
#+END_SRC

** Usage of the Arduino program

The arduino program is coming from an adaptation of https://github.com/rampadc/arduino-trackpoint-extended

You'll find it in firmware, it should work on Adafruit's Trinket M0 and any Arduino board able to do USB HID.

I'm giving a copy of it with the program to make it more convenient. I was not
able to get the streaming mode to work (really likely some timing issues).

You just have to put the CLK, DATA and RST pins you are using in the \#define at the beginning of the code and flash that.
